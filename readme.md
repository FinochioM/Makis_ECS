<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

My main goal with this library is to just offer a simple way to use ECS with the JAI programming language. At the start it was just something I wanted to do for my own personal projects but maybe it could also be useful for someone else's project

The CORE of this library was created by <a href="https://github.com/666rayen999">Rayen</a>, please check out his amazing stuff.

### Built With
The library is built with the JAI programming language and it is meant to be used in that same language. I am not really taking inspiration from anywhere, just adding whatever comes to mind or whatever I feel like "Oh this could be cool to add".

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

First of all, I want to make clear that you can just clone the repository and add/change whatever you want! There really is no license or rights for this library. Like I said, I am mainly doing this for my own personal use and I basically based this in an already existing library.

If you want to contribute to this particular project and help me add a new feature, you can just fork the repo and I'll take a look whenever I have time. I cannot promise I will tho, this is just a personal project and I will take my time to update it.
